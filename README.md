# project_detection_player_football_yolov5

<h4>This project includes monitoring for the detection and classification of players in real time in a football match video using YOLO5</h4>
<h6>using 4 Classes uses: <br/>
players, Goalkeeper, ball and ball referee<br/><br/>

tools to use:<br/>
Google Colab<br/>
YoloV5<br/>
Pytorch<br/>
RoboFlow for labeling video frames and pre-processing, or augmenting frames in this case <br/><br/><br/><br/>

the file 'yolov5n.pt' is the Yolov5 model weights https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5<br/>

The file 'best.pt' contains the best weights of the Yolov5 model trained on our dataset prepared by roboFlow <br><br/>
The last file 'last.pt'contains the last of the weights which produced the model <br><br>
